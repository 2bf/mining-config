My mining settings for mining on HiveOS with NBMiner on Ethereum.

NBminer
Algorithm: ETHASH
Wallet and worker template: %WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%
Pool URL: %URL%
Pass: x

EXTRA CONFIG ARGUMENTS: "lhr": 70
  LHR 70 setting unlocks 70% of mining strength for LHR (low hash rate) NVIDIA GPUs.
  LHR is a restriction on NVIDIA GPUs that make it worse for mining ETH,
  as a way to prevent miners from buying more cards and increasing marking prices.
